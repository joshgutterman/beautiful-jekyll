<h3>Autonomous Ocean Sediment Collection Device</h3>
<ul>
<li> For my Senior Capstone Project at the University of California, Santa Cruz myself and three other engineers worked to design, build, program, test and successfully launch the device you see above. We partnered with researchers at the Long Marine Lab in Santa Cruz to implement a more effective and easier to use method to collect sediment samples from the ocean floor. Using a large claw like device, the current method for sediment collection is expensive, dangerous, inefficient and takes up to five people to operate on a large boat. Our device can be operated by two people on a small research boat, and is controlled wirelessly via smartphone. Furthermore our device utilizes a standard 80 cubic foot scuba tank to power the vacuum collection system and to inflate the lift bag that enables retrieval at the surface. Creating a very efficient system that yields a high quantity of sediment. </li>
  
<li>Our first <a href="https://youtu.be/XYdfD2Cgkqw"><b>full system test</b></a> was completed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's 40 foot testing facility. We finished our project by having our first successful <a href="https://youtu.be/GIsuStNkBns"><b>ocean test</b></a> under the Monterey wharf where we successfully collected sediment samples. We then went on to win 3rd Place at the <a href="http://www.santacruztechbeat.com/2017/06/08/idea-hub-pitch-contest-winners-announced/"><b>IDEA Hub's Pitch for Social and Creative Enterprise</b></a> competition.</li>
