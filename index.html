<h3>Senior Design Project: Autonomous Ocean Sediment Collection Device</h3>
<ul>
<li> For my senior capstone project at the University of California, Santa Cruz myself and three other engineers worked to desing, build, test, program and successfully launch the device you see above. We partnered with the Long Marin Lab in Santa Cruz to impliment a more effective and easier to use method to collect sediment samples from the ocean floor to be used for research. Current methods for collect sediment use a large claw that is not only heavy, dangerous and not as effective, but takes up to 5 people to operate on a large boat. Our device can be operated by two people on a small research boat, and is conrolled wirelessly via a smartphone. Furhtermore our device utilizes a standard 80 cubic foot scuba tank to power the vacuum for collecting samples and to inflate the lift bag for retreaval. Creating a very efficent system with a high yeild in sediment. </li>
  
<li>Our first successfull full system test was completed at MBARI's 40 foot testing facility, and can been seen <a href="https://youtu.be/XYdfD2Cgkqw">here</a>. We finished our project by having a successful test out in the ocean under the Monterey wharf where we collected our first sediment samples. That video can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/GIsuStNkBns">here</a>. Lastly, we went on to win 3rd Place at the IDEA Hubâ€™s Pitch for Social and Creative Enterprise competition, more details <a href="http://www.santacruztechbeat.com/2017/06/08/idea-hub-pitch-contest-winners-announced/">here</a>.</li>
